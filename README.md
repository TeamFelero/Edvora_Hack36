## Introduction:
### Problem:
Many students struggle to find the right guidance outside the classroomâ€”whether it's choosing a career path, building skills, or simply navigating academic life. Traditional mentorship options are often limited, scattered, or hard to access. There's a lack of a centralized, secure, and accessible platform where students can connect with experienced mentors.
<br>
### Solution:
Our platform helps students find the right university by combining real reviews from recent seniors with simple, data-driven filtering tools. Instead of relying on scattered or outdated information, students can explore universities based on personalized preferences like budget, location, course offerings, and student experiences. With an intuitive search and filter system backed by straightforward math (like score-to-college match logic), we make the college selection process transparent, reliable, and community-driven.
